* Pick up / drop off loyalists
* Make sure that commands buried under 'more comments' are actually getting 
  processed (they appear to be now, but make sure) 
  * Is this still not working? http://www.reddit.com/r/ct_snooland/comments/1gx7b7/invasion_the_periwinkle_armies_march/caoqmid
  * But it works here http://www.reddit.com/r/ct_snooland/comments/1gx7b7/invasion_the_periwinkle_armies_march/caoqjgn
* Make us able to move multiple territories at once, but make the time
  equivilant to the number of moves
* Add an auto assign flair system to reduce confusion (/u/chromabot mods all
  terrotories and assings flairs when someone signs up on the recruitment
  thread)
* pm telling you your army has arrived
* Proper capital invasion
* Bot should listen to recruitment thread for commands(?)
* Better parse error messages if at all possible
* "committed your armies to the battle at" should link to said battle.
* Double check math here: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/ct_snooland/comments/1gx7b7/invasion_the_periwinkle_armies_march/
  * seems peri should have 0, I believe it's counting sub-skirmishes (which is probably fine?)
  * Totals seem way off: 277+40+80+50 != 1230.  May also not be counting sub-skirmishes in skirmish breakdown

* Link to battle thread in confirmation PM
* Timestamps in log
* Link to the commands reference in the text the bot posts up top
* Battle cooldown
* Battle troop rewards
* 'time' command
